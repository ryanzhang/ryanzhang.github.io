## Welcome

Welcome to the jekyll-reveal.js example presentation.

## Slide2
This is the second slide. And it's just another file inside the _posts-directory.

It is identified as slide 2, because it has a "2" after the mandatory date-part (0000-01-01) in its
filename. (It's called 0000-01-02-slides.md)

This is a third slide, although we're still in 0000-01-02-slides.md.
